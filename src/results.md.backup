# Descrete approximation - results

## Data

Using [numerical methods](./approach.md) we can download and collect [data](images/HotApplePie.xlsx) for a range of lengths.

## End profile

![](images/profiles.png)

* As we predicted in our [short length analysis](./short.md), the profile is increasingly flat when limited by small \\(L\\)
* The end slope is \\(45\^{\circ}\\) for all lengths, as we had [predicted](./extremal.md).
* For large \\(L\\) the profile approaches a [\\(\sin()\\)](./long.md)

## Volume

![](images/volume.png)

This is the "normalized" volume for optimum solution given a length relative to width (unfolded).

Note that there is 2 regions:

* for \\(L/W < 1\\) the length of the tab is constrained by the length of the box.
* for \\(L/W > 1\\) the length of the tab is limited by the maximum slope \\(45\^{\circ}\\).

Both regions are linear (for a log/log plot).

## Compare
