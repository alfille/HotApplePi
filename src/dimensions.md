# Dimensions

For the quarter panel:

For the quarter section, before folding:

* Width \\(W\\)
* Length \\(L\\)
* Horizontal variable \\(s\\)
* Crease at \\(f(s)\\)

### Constraints:
\\[0 \leq s \leq W \\]
\\[f(0)=0, \quad f(W)=0\\]
\\[0 \leq f(s) \leq L\\]

## Normalized

Note that all thedimensions have units of length. We can *normalize* by choosing one dimention as the *characteristic length* and making all the others a ratio to that one.

Since we will want to see the effect of different *L*, we will make the width *W* the characteristic length.

\\[\hat{L} = L / W\\]
\\[\hat{s} = s/W\\]
\\[\hat{f}(\hat{s})=\frac{f(s/W)}{W}\\]

### Constraints:
\\[0 \leq \hat{s} \leq 1 \\]
\\[\hat{f}(0)=0, \quad \hat{f}(1)=0\\]
\\[0 \leq \hat{f}(\hat{s}) \leq \hat{L}\\]
