[Pinhole-js](https://github.com/tidwall/pinhole-js/tree/master) is a pure Javascript program by Josh Baker that rotates a line drawing on the HTML Canvas.

It is apparently based on his Go program [Pinhole](https://github.com/tidwall/pinhole)

The code is MIT licensed, simple and reviewed (by me) for safety.

## Modifications

We use a [fork of Pinhole](https://github.com/alfille/pinhole-js) with the following modifications:

* Added tthtic's [ellipse](https://github.com/tthtlc/pinhole-js/tree/master)
* changed to Javascript classes (i.e. E6 syntax)
* removed most global "vars"
* Moved the rotating event loop out of the main code body
* Added control buttons
* Added Web worker function to offload computation and display. This splits the project into:
  * Front end for control and interaction
  * Back end for display and rotation

## Front end

This part performs:

* Launch web worker (back end).
* Send graphics construction
* manage controls (buttons)

The front end is [pinhole-front.js](https://github.com/alfille/HotApplePi/js/pinhole-front.js) and should be added as a script in the main html file. In exposes 4 interfaces:

* new Pinhole(canvas_id) 
* Pinhole.buttons(button_div_id)
* Pinhole.scale(scale_factor) for a global scale factor (for all subsequent entries)
* Pinhole.ops([oplist]) in format below 

## Back end

Uses an offscreen canvas sent by front-end to display and rotate image

Stores construction and rotation parametes

## Communication

Web-worker standard: PostMessage front->back
Communication is all one-way.

### Messages
