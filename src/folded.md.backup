# Folded

## Coordinates

![](images/Coordinates.png)

In folding the box:

* The length dimension (along *L*) becomes the *y* coordinate
* The width (*s* coordinate) now bends in the *x*/*z* plane

## Dimensions

![](images/PaperFlat.jpg)

Here is an example (simple) curve on a flat piece of paper. The *s* dimension is the width, and the curve is described as \\(f(s)\\)

Once folded, the new coordinates are shown

* *s* now follows the rule lines of the notepaper. It curves in the *x*/*z plane.
* The height of the surface in the *z* direction is \\(f(s)\\)
* the *x* dimension is compressed from *s* because of the curve

## Equations

\\[{ds}\^2 = {dx}\^2+{dz}\^2\\]
where \\(z=f(s)\\)
